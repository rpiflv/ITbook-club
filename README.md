## About The Project
This application has been designed for those who want to share their reviews and comments about the latest released books on IT. Look up for a book and make your post about it!

## Built With <a hrer="https://rubyonrails.org/"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/67497636/220000643-b6bbd8fb-6a22-4192-80f7-08c2dfce721b.png" alt="rails" width="50" height="50"/></a>

I have only used Ruby on Rails to build this application, as this specific tech perfectly fits the project's requirements. A third party API is used to collect information aboiut the latest book released.
